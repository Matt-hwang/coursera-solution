                <h2>Winter Games</h2>
                <p>
                    The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. 
                    Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. 
                    The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, 
                    it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 
                    in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games.
                    Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. 
                    The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. 
                    This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, 
                    the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics

                <h2>Paralympics</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after World War II, organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics. 
                    Guttmann's event, known then as the Stoke Mandeville Games, became an annual sports festival. Over the next twelve years, 
                    Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing. For the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, 
                    Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the "Parallel Olympics", which became known as the first Paralympics. 
                    Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year. Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, 
                    the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics. In 2001 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
                    and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage 
                    both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.[50][51] The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, 
                    and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Chairman of the London organising committee, Lord Coe, 
                    said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and Olympics in London that, We want to change public attitudes 
                    towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset 
                    that the two Games are an integrated whole.

                <h2>Youth Games</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. 
                    The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC.
                    The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14â€“26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck,
                    Austria, two years later.These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, 
                    while the winter version will last nine days.The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, 
                    and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled 
                    for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.
