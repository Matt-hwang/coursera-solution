                <p>
                    The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. 
                    Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. 
                    The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, 
                    it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 
                    in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games.
                    Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. 
                    The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. 
                    This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, 
                    the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics
